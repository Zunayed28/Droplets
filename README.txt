# Droplets
## Designing beautiful droplets using only HTML5 and CSS

HOLA! This is Zunayed. In this repository, I've put all the files required to produce beautiful water droplets on your web.
To do so, I used only a HTML file and a CSS file. The HTML file holds the property to show the web page as a whole and the most
importantly CSS file holds the entire blueprint of the droplets. The PNG file contains an image of how the droplets should look
according to my codes.

Feel free to download and edit the codes using any text editor. Suggest me to make better contents and please give me interesting
tips for my improvement. CHEERS!
